##Number Lookup using FonB

FonB provides many useful features and Number Lookup is one of them. The goal of this feature is to provide a name to all numbers available in any of the Phonebook FonB supports (Google, Highrise, MyContacts, iPhone & Asterisk Extensions). It's more or less same as CallerID Superfacta however, it comes with FonB (without any extra installation steps).

##Configuration

Number Lookup feature is dependent upon DID and requires it to be setup with extension. Assuming that you have extension 7711 with DID 4547711, you will have to mention the same DID in your users.cfg file (without any access code). It's important that both numbers are matched otherwise FonB will not bring Caller Name on your IP Phone.
