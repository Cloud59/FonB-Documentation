One of the main features of Aptus FonB is the XML Phonebook App for IP Phones that enables any IP Phone to provide same functionality as that of the Web Interface. Unlike ordinary Phonebook or Contact List apps, FonB XML Phonebook App provides the Call History of all the calls made from or received on any of the IP Phones, Webphone or Mobile App with single registered extension. Thus, if you have extension 2000 registered on your IP deskphone, in your FonB Webphone and in your Mobile App, XML Phonebook App will show you in your IP Deskphone the calls made from or to all of these choices, unlike native IP Phone Apps showing calls made from or to your IP Phone alone.

Furthermore, using XML Phonebook App, you are free to search contacts from any phonebook you have, i.e. right from your IP Phone, you will be able to search your Google Contacts, your Highrise contacts, your My Contacts or contacts from your Internal Asterisk Server.

The list of IP Phone vendors and models is never ending. Thus, this page is supposed to get updated on frequent basis as we are testing XML Phonebook App with new phones each day.

Currently, XML Phonebook App is working with the IP Phones from one of these:

1. [Polycom](#http://www.polycom.com/products-services/resources/products-services-a-z.html)

2. [Grandstream](#http://www.grandstream.com/index.php/products/ip-voice-telephony/enterprise-ip-phones)

3. [Aastra](#http://www.aastra.com/product-families.htm?curr_cat=SIP+Telephones&curr_type=Family&mode_f=1&mode_c=1&mode_l=2)

4. [Yealink](#http://www.yealink.com/product_list.aspx?BaseInfoCateId=147&CateId=147&ProductsCateID=147)

5. [Snom](#http://www.snom.com/en/products/snom-ip-phones-at-a-glance/)

Aptus has also developed custom dedicated App for Digium that works on Javascript instead of XML. This was possible because of Digium API for their IP Phones. By far, Digium displays one of the most elegant Apps for IP Phones and stand unique among all the other vendors. Further details about FonB App for Digium can be viewed [here](#here).
